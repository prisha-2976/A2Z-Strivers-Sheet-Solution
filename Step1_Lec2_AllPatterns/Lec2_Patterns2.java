/*Problem statement
Sam is making a forest visualizer. An N-dimensional forest is represented by the pattern of size NxN filled with ‘*’.

An N/2-dimensional forest is represented by the lower triangle of the pattern filled with ‘*’.

For every value of ‘N’, help sam to print the corresponding N/2-dimensional forest.

Example:
Input:  ‘N’ = 3

Output: 
* 
* *
* * *

Constraints :
1  <= N <= 25
Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1:
3
Sample Output 1:
